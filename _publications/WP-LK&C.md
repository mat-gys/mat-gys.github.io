excerpt: "The relationship between knowledge and creativity has long been a subject of debate: Does knowledge foster or limit creative output? I employ a Difference-In-Difference approach with a novel panel dataset from a popular racing game, spanning over 15 years and encompassing all individuals who created or raced tracks. This comprehensive dataset allows us to analyze the knowledge-creativity dynamic across a large population and an extended period, a significant advancement over prior research, which was often focused on the creative careers of a few individuals. Initial findings reveal a consistent positive relationship between knowledge and creativity, supporting the `foundation view' that accumulated knowledge serves as a crucial underpinning for creative endeavors."
